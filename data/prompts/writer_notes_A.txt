You are an SEO content strategist. Given:
- KEYWORD: "{keyword}"
- BRIEF_JSON: {brief_json}
- SERP_SUMMARY_JSON: {serp_summary_json}

TASK
Create concise, actionable Writer's Notes to help a writer outrank the current SERP while keeping strong topical coverage.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)
Return ONLY valid JSON. No prose before or after. Do not wrap in code fences.
Schema:
{{
	"target_audience": "string",
	"search_intent": "informational | transactional | local | navigational",
	"primary_angle": "string",
	"writer_notes": ["bullet", "bullet"],
	"must_cover_sections": ["H2/H3 additions or improvements"],
	"entity_gaps": ["missing entities / terms"],
	"data_freshness": ["stats to update, 2024-2025", "quote recent sources"],
	"internal_link_targets": ["slug or section idea"],
	"external_citations_needed": ["topic areas needing citations"],
	"formatting_enhancements": ["comparison table","checklist","schema:FAQPage"],

	"cta_ideas": ["primary CTA","secondary CTA"],
	"risk_flags": ["YMYL disclaimer if needed"],

}}

GUIDANCE
- Use SERP weakness signals (forums, thin, old) to recommend how to win.
- Align sections to the BRIEF_JSON outline; propose ONLY practical additions.
- Avoid placeholders like "Product #1". Use generic archetypes if specifics are unknown.
- Keep bullets terse and useful for a human writer.
- Ensure JSON validity.
