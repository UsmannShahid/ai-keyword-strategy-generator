# Frontend (Free) Wrapper

This is a lightweight wrapper around the existing Next.js app at `free-version/frontend`.

- Dev: `npm run dev` (proxies to the original app)
- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm run start`

When you're ready to fully migrate, move the project here and remove the wrapper scripts.
